                After suffering another Hawkeye post season bowl fail, I awoke in a house on the beach, went to a local doughnut shop and got a dozen treats for my kids. A very uncharacteristic move that stunned my (adult) children; they thought someone invaded my body. Bring it on 2017!!
<br><br>
Following the unexpected morning sugar fest, I got the opportunity for a run on the beach. My mind began to percolate; pieces of songs filtered in as the white sand was smooth and oddly vacant. I generally consider my runs as meditation sessions.  As my feet were moving, my mind sauntered off on its own.  All of a sudden the lyrical hook "Just for a moment, let's be still" appeared on my conscious horizon.  As a yoga teacher who likes playing music, this song could easily be titled the savasana song. For those of you less familiar with yoga, that is when you take a 5 minute nap at the end.
<br><br>
I saw this band at the Austin City Limits (ACL) music festival a few years back. I'm always enamored by duet dynamics. This song falls into that category. Duos can't be forced. Some people compliment others whether it be in song, at work, in relationships, etc.  Also, I must mention the interesting way in which the song sounds like as if it's over but ultimately opens back up for an encore.
<br><br>
The song is simple. In contrast, life frequently is not.  Sometimes we voluntarily contribute to our own chaos. I heard someone at a yoga workshop say that those who need savasana the most are the ones most unwilling to participate in it. I encourage you to take a listen to this song and follow its simple instructions. Repeat daily :) Our savasana may look different, but figure out what it looks like for you and go there. You deserve it.
