I purchased this cd in 1998-ish. The artwork was on a sunny yellow backdrop displaying a seated guy with a floppy hat on. I am uncertain why I remember the New Radicals one and only CD cover, but I do. It’s locked and loaded in my memory.
<br><br>
The band basically revolved around one dude. The supporting cast rotated in and out during their hyper short career. I liked song #17 the the first time I heard it on the FM radio; I searched for the mystery artist on the airwaves.  Back in the day, you couldn’t simply drop a half a sentence of lyrics into google and be magically gifted a bands name. If you were lucky the DJ would chime in and extend props to the group during commercial break. 
<br><br>
For me, all it took was one well liked canticle and my wallet made it’s way to the music store. 
When my kids were little, discretionary dollars were limited, but I never skimped on purchasing new music. I considered it an investment in my mental health and an enrichment tool for my children :)

"You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget
We only get what we give”
<br><br>
^^^^^ Those lyrics are motivating! Sometimes our inner self must be our cheerleader.  
"You get what you give"
 I've used those 5 words more than once!
