 Mary Tyler Moore died today; she was 80 years old. Many people remember her as the
actress on her self-titled show which distinctively featured her tossing her hat up in the
air while the theme music played. Midwesterners are familiar with the landmarks in
downtown Minneapolis where the intro was shot; Minnesota Vikings&#39; fans in particular
remember her wearing Sir Francis Tarkenton's #10 jersey during the roll of the opening
credits.
<br><br>
When I heard that she'd past, this song instantly came into my mind. I found it on
Spotify and gave it a listen. Most of us can recite its lyrics in their entirety without any
necessary prompts.
<br><br>
The MTM Show gave celebration to single, working women. When my parents and I
watched Mary's weekly offering (in our vintage 1970s family room), I had no idea that
her show would be recognized as a transformational series that would be talked about
for years to come. Thanks for the laughs (and cries) Ms. Moore!
<br><br>
“Who can turn the world on with her smile?
Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?
Well it&#39;s you girl, and you should know it
With each glance and every little movement you show it
Love is all around, no need to waste it
You can never tell, why don&#39;t you take it
You&#39;re gonna make it after all….”
