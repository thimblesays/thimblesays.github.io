              This song has always spoken to me.  Ever since college, I have been a huge Neil Young fan.  Accordingly, I have acquired a substantial amount of vinyl sporting his name.
                <br><br>
I found Young's "Old Man" particularly intriguing because he wrote and produced the song when he was in his mere 20s.  Young's insight at such a young age is pretty damn cool.  Contrarily, my 20s was plagued with self involvement.  I enjoyed being surrounded by people my own age and discussing issues that I believed only my fellow generational friends could understand (#SELFCENTERED).<br><br>
Young's song title itself, "Old Man", crosses the generational divide.  The song's simple yet most known phrase, "Old man look at my life, I'm a lot like you", immediately drew my attention towards my father.  Although, I know that was not the intent of this verse.<br><br>
"Old Man" is a comfort song for me. It is simultaneously sweet, introspective, and humble. While Neil Young has an exhaustive library of music, this is certainly the song with which I want to begin.
