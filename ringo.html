Are you good at asking for help? Are you good at accepting it? I’m kinda thinking that there are two types of people who struggle with the H word. 
<br><br>
People unwilling to give up power over a situation: “I must do it all, I want all the credit and notoriety.”
People who do not want to be a burden on others: “I can’t possibly ask for help, people are to busy with their own stuff."
<br><br>
Two valid yet different reasons not reaching out to your network of peeps.  Pretty sure I’ve graduated during the course of my life from #1 in my 20’s and 30’s to #2 in the present tense. 
<br><br>
This song popped into my head today. I know it’s a Beatles song, but I think that Joe Cocker gave it personality. I remember watching him belt out the lyrics on the T.V.  and thinking that every ounce of his body was involved. It was musical passion in the flesh, experienced through our “low-fi" 24 inch Sony. Cocker is not the only performer to cover this song. I do think he got it right, though.
<br><br>
"What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key.
<br><br>
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends..”
<br><br>
Thanks to all of mine :)
