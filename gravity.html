                For 11 years, I coached the Urbandale High School varsity dance team. I have a lifetime of memories being a coach. Most are positive, but there certainly are situations that I wish I had a "do-over" on. I’m fairly certain that I learned more from the dancers than they did from me.  I gained meaningful lessons that shaped me into the person that I am today. 
<br><br>
Last night as I was scrolling through Facebook, I happened upon a memory post of a lyrical dance the UHSDT performed during the 2012-2013 season. The song was choreographed by my oldest daughter, Elaine, to the song "Gravity" by Sara Bareilles.
<br><br>
For three of my years leading the UHSDT, I was fortunate enough to have a young man on the team. This was uncommon in the high school dance team world. He is, to this day, an excellent dancer. A male added both an element of interest (and difficulty) in choreographing pieces. For this dance, we embraced the opportunity! Song #18 is absolutely beautiful. Our dance masterfully set the story of the lyrics to movement. 
<br><br>
My husband fancied himself as our teams videographer. He took this role pretty seriously, adding intros and fade outs to his footage. He told me that this dance always choked him up.  Prior to this, the UHSDT had never competed a lyrical style of dance. 
<br><br>
Watching it on FB 4 years later gave me pause. 
<br><br>
"Here I am, and I stand
So tall, just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me…”
<br><br>
The choreography assigned to the lyrics written above was my favorite part of the dance! A beautiful dancer with an outstanding leg extension made crystal clear the connection between the song and the choreography. Gravity had many awesome moments and ended in an embrace. 
<br><br>
We didn't end up with the hardware at the state completion that year, but it was a crowd pleaser that put music to motion.
<br><br>
Here is my daily challenge to you; the next time you listen to an emotional song, imagine what it might LOOK like :)
