Last night, my son asked me what my favorite Beatles song was. Whaaaat?! Now that is a complex question. The prolifacy of this band is mind blowing. One possible way of breaking down the equation is figuring out who your favorite band mate is: John, Ringo, George, or Paul. An argument can be made for each of them. All four have charming qualities and did their respective jobs outstandingly. 
<br><br>
Notwithstanding, I fall into the Lennon camp. 
I read a compilation of his poems when I was in high school and fell in love. I’m fairly certain that if I dug through some boxes in my attic, I could find this worn out book of poems. Additionally, I’ve enjoyed the John Lennon documentary on numerous occasions.   
<br><br>
That being said, the song that rises to the top for me is sung by Paul: “Let it Be”.  Albeit, I assure you that Lennon will make his way into this blog in the coming days. 
<br><br>
The simplicity in the message of this song amazes me. This was the Beatles final song after "Sir Paul" announced that he would be leaving the band. Along with the Fab 4, Billy Preston played the organ on this ballad. 
<br><br>
When I was younger, I remember learning that this song was about McCartney’s mom. What better a person to express the message "let it be" than your momma. Imagine the worry we can save ourselves if we simply let stuff be. Especially the stuff that we can’t change. 
<br><br>
I suppose a band as individually and collectively talented as the Beatles could not stay together any longer than they did. What they did in those 8 years together will forever be discussed by music lovers, like myself, and pop culture students. They created a musical chapter in history that should be required listening.
