            StoryToday’s the beginning of the second week of January. Sundays are often reset buttons. We begin our weeks with goals, intentions, hope and vigor.  In many ways, the turn of a new calendar year is a time that many people reflect on their previous year and set resolutions. 
<br><br>
This tune is one that I love to play at the start of yoga class. It's  also a song that I think about prior to rolling out my own mat. The second verse of the song goes:
<br><br>
          Breath, breath in the air 
          Set your intentions.
          Dream with care. 
<br><br>
"Dream with care….” hmmm… that  is a nugget worth noting)
<br><br>
I think that setting intentions is a much better idea than making resolutions. 
A resolution is a firm decision to do or not do something. 
An intention is a thing intended; an aim or plan.
We could break this down further, but I imagine that you see differences. 
<br><br>
In the referenced verse, Rudd goes on to say:
<br><br>
          Tomorrow is a new day for everyone,
          Brand new moon, brand new sun. 
<br><br>
Perhaps setting intentions each day, in our present situations will, over time, equate to something much greater. 
<br><br>
I really hope that you check out this song.  Oh, the wisdom!
Have a great week my friends. Let each and everyday be filled with something that helps you grow :)
