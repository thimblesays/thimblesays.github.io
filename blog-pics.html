                Story I'm still in Clearwater Beach, FL.  I listened to Katie Couric's podcast during my final beach run as she interviewed David Farenthold. I really enjoy her weekly podcast and this final one of 2016 was perfect fuel for my jaunt.  In full disclosure,  I should probably categorize it as a light jog since I was passed by several shirtless (over-tanned) retirees.

                I followed this year's election way too closely.  For those of you who aren't familiar with DF, you should acquaint yourself with his work. If you live in Iowa, DF's old school brand of journalism started on the days leading up to the Iowa Caucuses. Armed with a legal pad and a nose for corruption, he began to dig into the dirt surrounding Donald Trump and his philanthropic past (or lack thereof).  He subsequently broke the Access Hollywood story which, for a period, titled the election towards HRC.  Sadly, I started to think of Trump (and his illusions of sexual grandeur) wondering what song in my mind represents him. Two and a half miles later...boom... there it was: "Mambo #5!"

                    I don't particularly like this song or think that it will be recognized by the Rock and Roll HOF as musical brilliance, but I don't hate it either- it makes your toes tap and your head sway. In fairness, it's a fun song to get your dance on.  It's a tune that a local cover band would easily learn and incorporate into its crappy set list up or a wedding DJ would spin to get the geezers up and dancing.  No disrespect to Lou, but I don't think that this song was ever meant to be taken seriously. "I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita....." I imagine that if DJT knew that someone associated him with this song, he'd consider it a HUGE compliment.... sigh...
