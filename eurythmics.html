Saturday, January 21, 2017, will be remembered as a massive women’s march on Washington, accompanied by sister marches around the world; the visual was amazing. It was a great display of peaceful democracy in motion. A march of this magnitude rolling out the day after the swearing in of our 45th president clearly indicates that we’re living in tumultuous times.
<br><br>
I'm a #blessed woman who has two motivated and insightful daughters. They’re far stronger than I'll ever be. They speak their mind and pursue goals, knowing that staying ethically true and character cognizant will enable them to do anything. I’m proud of their passion to make the world a better place, applying their talents as they go forward.
<br><br>
While feeling the love of the Women’s March, this song rose to the top for today's celebration. I’ve always been an Annie Lennox fan and this particular tune has always been one of my favorites from the Eurythmics’ catalog. Joining Annie on this anthem is the legendary Aretha Franklin. This song from 1985 spoke to the feminist movement occurring then as it does now. 
<br><br>
Consider the following lyrics 
<br><br>
"Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the female state!
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too.
Woman to woman
We’re singing with you…..”
<br><br>
Brothers and sisters, now is the time to let your voices be heard! Don’t stop there: get involved, make the world a better place. What are YOU passionate about? Education, non-profit work, disabilities advocacy, mental health??  Figure it out and roll up your sleeves. We’re undoubtedly stronger united. Now’s not the time to sit on the sidelines. Pick your cause and lift it. 
<br><br>
