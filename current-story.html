            <h1>Donald Trump is a Fuckhead.</h1>
            <h2>05.07.16</h2>
            <p>
                I am embarrassed to admit that my husband and I went to a Rush Limbaugh show in the 90's. At that time in my life, I was newly married and preparing to have my first child. I spent my days as a marketing representative, driving through the state of Iowa. Rush dominated the AM airtime in the afternoons. His message style was brash and combative. He created a political shock value. It was amusing. My interest in politics, at that time was minimal.
                <br><br>
Over time, Rush went from being an entertainer to a creator of a radio genre. It was a movement that proved years of negative narrative became equivalent with fact and truth for many. Mostly by playing on the fears of those people who followed his lead, with little fact checking. 
The birth of Mr. Limbaugh 's rhetoric paved the way for other like minded spin off radio shows on the local and national levels. Fear sells undoubtedly!
                <br><br>
Fast forward to 2016. Question; what does decades of hate radio create? 
Answer; Donald Trump!
                <br><br>
He is the byproduct of the constant grind of relentless rhetoric that spoon fed anyone who had too much free time. 
Ironic that Rush Limbaugh is not an enthusiastic fan of the leading man of his beloved party? I don't think so. 
He created the beast. Trump followed his lead and took it to the streets. He created the optic for the voice that Rush birthed. Deep down Rush Limbaugh knows this and secretly accepts the credit. 
The Republican Party is a few months from turning upside down and inside out. For that, those on the right can thank the Southeast Missouri State dropout turned entertainer, Mr. Limbaugh.
                <br><br>
I remember very little from the "Rush Show" that I say back in the early 90's. The one thing I do recall with total certainly was him walking out at the end of the talk and stating that he was simply an "entertainer". He knew what he was. Over the years, perhaps he lost sight of his role.
