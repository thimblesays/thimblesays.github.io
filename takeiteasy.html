            <p>
Five short winters ago, I noticed a new woman in my early a.m. cycle class at the Y (I'll needlessly call her "Suzy" for anonymity reasons). Suzy became a regular and always sat in the back row, to my right and under the fan (she's obviously smart). Her attendance along with her “get after it” effort became routine. Right around that same time, I started seeing a new guy in class (I'll call him "Barry," again, for no particular reason). Friendly and talkative, Barry usually grabbed a seat in the front row. It wasn't until many months later that I connected the dots and concluded that little Miss determined Suzy and Mr. chatty Barry were married to one another!!
                <br><br>
I sleuthed together this marital discovery when I went downtown (DSM) on a whim to a lululemon community yoga class.  Suzy was teaching the yoga session and happy-go-lucky Barry was stationed in the back row of this vinyasa flow class, not nearly as bubbly as cycling Barry. HA!! I was pleasantly surprised by the style and spirit. Suzy had a super cool Australian accent and also taught yoga…who'd a thought???
            <br><br>
I distinctly remember Suzy putting us in plank pose and then saying, “this is usually the time when I pull out a joke or two...” I thought to myself that this woman is simultaneously full of personality and evil goodness (an interesting contrast). Our friendship blossomed. Suzy likes cycling, I like cycling. Suzy likes yoga, I like yoga, Suzy likes the Eagles, I like the Eagles. Hmmmmm...
                <br><br>
A year into our friendship, Suzy decided to open her own yoga studio. It was no surprise that this newcomer to DSM (she's originally from "Down Under") would be a successful entrepreneur. She had a personality to which people were drawn and the skills by which to teach a fascinating class. I was lucky enough to see her at the Y and help support her business as well. Our friendship continued to grow.
                <br><br>
In the late Summer of 2014, I shared with Pauline (I used the fake name "Suzy" to keep you all in suspense as to her actual identity) that my husband had gotten us tickets to The History of the Eagles concert taking place at Wells Fargo Arena (a/k/a the "Well") in early September. Pauline thought that her husband, Richard (previously known as "Barry" in this story), would enjoy the show as well and commenced a search for tickets. Party on! 
                <br><br>
We decided to meet for dinner at Django before the concert. After great conversation and tasty cuisine, we realized that we all needed to bust a move to get to the Well in time. We said our goodbyes and went on our mutual ways. Erik and I arrived at the show and per custom, he promptly secured us some adult beverages. We quickly summoned the assistance of an usher and squinted our way to our seats in the darkened arena. I didn't know where Pauline and Richard were sitting but knew that they were in the same general area. As fate would have it, seated LITERALLY right next me were Pauline and Richard!! It was a somewhat surreal moment as the Well ain’t exactly the size of Carl's Place (local bar) and it was close to, if not sold out.  
                <br><br>
That night formed a memory that I hold close to my heart. Music's an outstanding inspirational platform that's meant to be shared with friends. The Eagles did not disappoint, nor did the company with whom I shared them. We all knew their entire set list (as did everyone else in the Well) and gratuitously provided the Eagles with backing vocals!!
                <br><br>
Today (sadly for me), Pauline's loading up her car, daughters and dogs in tow, in route to her next adventure in Houston, Texas to meet up with Richard (who's already started his new job there). As the sun comes up and you begin your descent southward to the Capitol of the Sunbelt, I say this to you my friend: "take it easy..." XOXOXO
