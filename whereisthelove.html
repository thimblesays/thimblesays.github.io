Today we observe Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. He's among the top 5 of people that I wish I could’ve met. 
<br><br>
When my oldest daughter (Elaine a/k/a “Lainey”) was in 2nd grade, she did a detailed presentation of Dr. King’s work during the 1960’s civil rights movement; she spent the entire semester working on it. Lainey was one of a handful of children in the school district doing an historically based project. The presentations took place on a weeknight so that family and friends could attend. The child presenters were encouraged to dress up as their respective iconic figures. Lainey wore a suit, hat and a vintage MLK (fake) mustache. I was so proud of her for picking someone who'd made such a positive impact on our nation! 
<br><br>
Yesterday, I was telling my (now) adult kids that I wanted to pick a meaningful song for MLK day. After a moment, we all kind of said, “Where is the Love” and immediately jumped on the melody  Black Eyed Peas definitely would not have been down with our rendition as we butchered the harmony mercilessly. Even though the song's a solid 13 years old, we did a pretty good job remembering its lyrics. 
<br><br>
I think that Dr. King would've liked this song. Its lyrics have substance. They speak in the most basic way to the problems of our nation. MLK Jr. started the conversation; it’s essential that we keep it going... 
 <br><br>
"Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y’all…."
