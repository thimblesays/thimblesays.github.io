                This weekend is the game before the game, before the game: The NFL Divisional Round.
As Vikings fans, my family is on the outside looking in at these matchups. Fellow #skol brothers and sisters have reluctantly put their purple away when the possibility of being part of the post season excitement became ruled out a few weeks ago.  
<br><br>
“Any Given Sunday” is a song by Jamie Foxx about (professional) football. It is also a song about life. 
The chorus goes like this;
"Sacrifice don't give up the fight,
everything will be all right on any given Sunday
[Guru:] The harder they come the hard, yeah the harder they must fall
Depends on you if you win or lose,
you know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday
[Guru:] Strive to achieve and die for what you believe”
<br><br>
This is a song that I never get sick of. The words are straightforward; it’s about self belief to the point that you bring the best version of yourself in any given situation. Easier said than done, right? Sometimes, our minutes, hours, days, weeks, and years position us in situations that require a punt. Whether it be a lost relationship, health problems, or a professional hardship, picking yourself up off the turf to figure out your next move is how life rolls. That does not mean that you can’t ask for a little help. There is little we can do alone. 
No running back moves up the field without the O-line making a hole to slide through. 
That’s teamwork.  When executed properly, it’s a beautiful thing.
<br><br>
“Strive to achieve and die for what you believe…”
<br><br>
This line says so much. It defines character. It helps you figure out whose team you are on. 
<br><br>
Make it a regular practice to reflect on what you believe in. That will help you figure out if you are on the right team.
