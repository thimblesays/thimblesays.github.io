David Bowie was one of the plethora of musicians to depart us in 2016. His death affected me. Ziggy Stardust seemed invincible. Bowie was a visionary. He sings in color! His musical library saw no real genre boundaries.  For me, his songs were attached to vivid memories. 
<br><br>
“Changes" is a song that comes to mind today. New year, new stuff, new challenges, new experiences, new schedules. 
Changes bring about vulnerability. How we cope with those vulnerabilities is how we grow….or die. 
I settle into routines well. Usually that routine includes scheduled chaos with little room for missteps.  I am good with that. 
<br><br>
I once heard in a training that our brains perform on "auto pilot" a significant percentage of each day. For example, if we start our day somewhere different than our routine  destination to work, we often times end up taking a wrong turn.
<br><br>
Slight change can makes us feel a little more alert. Blurred lines become focused. We feel a little more alive!
<br><br>
Sometimes change is inevitable. We don’t have to always like it, but we do have to accept it. It allows us to see things from  a different perspective. What shifts can you make in your life that might be of benefit? Pick one. See if it wakes you up!

"Time may change me 
But I can’t trace time 
I said that time may change me 
But I can’t trace time"

Peace
