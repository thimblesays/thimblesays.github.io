            Today I was having an average Tuesday at work. Late in the afternoon, I checked my
makeshift office mailbox. In it was an envelope with my first name on it and enough girth
to know that it was more than one page. Uh-oh...
<br><br>
At first thought, I imagined that it might be a complaint from a member or a letter of
resignation. How’s that for optimism???
<br><br>
Upon opening it, I found an extensive list of Beatles&#39; songs and a hand written note of
three short sentences that read: “205 songs. Almost 7 months of writing. You did not
mention “Penny Lane” in your top 5 Beatles songs.” Hmmmm...
<br><br>
Last week, I was having a conversation with my friend Bob (from early AM yoga) about
the Beatles. I shared with him of my pursuit of a daily song blog. I told Bob about the
previous night when my son had asked me which was my favorite Fab 4 song (see
Song #19 post). As I perused this issue with Bob, I was still pondering my answer. We
jointly rattled off a number of songs which we thought could earn top honor. Incidentally,
Bob (like my hubby) is a big George fan (gotta love the slide guitar).
<br><br>
The note (of girth) today was from Bob. How could I have possibly forgotten the song
that celebrates my own name? I’ve spent the night humming the song about the street
where Lennon and McCartney caught the bus as children. &quot;Penny Lane&quot; is a real street
in Liverpool and is quite famous to this day.
<br><br>
This song was undoubtedly my favorite Beatles tune as a little girl. It made me feel
special hearing my name sung out by the world’s most popular band. My brother and
sisters had the album and made it a staple in their regular rotation in the basement
family room of our childhood house.
<br><br>
Penny Lane paints the picture of city street on a beautiful day. There is nothing not to
like about it. Especially the title, lol! Thanks Bob for the reminder!
<br><br>
“Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back..”
