                I was going about my business today.  Smack dab in the middle of my Mondays, I teach a cycle class at the downtown Y. For unknown reasons this particular time slot is mostly dudes. I imagine the women are participating in a workout far more grueling, lol, :) 
<br><br>
As Januarys tend to be, we were at maximum capacity. The group was working hard as far as I could tell. The scant group of women were dictating the effort level. JK… sort of … 
<br><br>
About half way through class, Sugar Magnolia came on my playlist. It was a clear game changer from my vantage point. 
<br><br>
The Dead was a prolific group that toured well.That being said, they only had a handful of well known tunes. This song is probably one of them. It was clear that about a third of the class got a little more connected to their pedal stroke when this song came on. I saw the fellas mouthing the words and giving the tempo head nod as the song continued. Case closed! Song of the day decided by the riders with a clear understanding of quality music. 
<br><br>
The Dead was the first concert that I saw with my husband. We were young and wrinkle free. 
We saw them in KC on the 4th of July. I will leave the year out.(hint -JG was alive and kickin’)
<br><br>
I sensed that it made those taking in the the energy of this simple song today felt a year or two younger…
<br><br>
"Sunshine daydream
Walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose…”
<br><br>
If nothing else, it drew their attention off the hill they were climbing.
