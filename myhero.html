It's Friday! Fridays make me think of Foo Fighters (note: it's "Foo
Fighters," not "THE" Foo Fighters).  Simply put, FF is a group that defines cool. They treat their fans with long and hard sets and appear to be pretty normal dudes who just happen to have wicked talent for working up the masses with their throbbing rock and roll vibe.

Today, my 23 year old son (who just graduated from college and thankfully is leaving my personal payroll), came to my spin class at the Y.  After the session, I noticed him conversing with a gentleman 60 years his elder (also in class) who apparently impressed my boy (he's still my boy) with the multiple full and half marathons notched among running achievements. I eventually overheard my son say: "Damn Irv, you're my hero dude!" Hence, the genesis of today's song:)
<br><br>
"My Hero" stands out for all the right reasons. It states: "There goes my hero, (s)he's ordinary..." which is a particular phrase that has always stuck with me. Isn't that who our heroes should be?  Someone who inspires us?  Someone with a story?  Someone who gave us a break when we needed it, picked us up when we're at the end of our rope?  Look around; these people are likely within reach.

Who're heroic figures to you? The next time you see one of them, give 'em a shout out!
