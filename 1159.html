                Today's my birthday. It was spent in planes, trains and automobiles (literally). My family left a comfortable 72 degrees + sun in Florida for a return trek to the frozen tundra of the Midwest with its welcoming -2.  My birthday's always sort of been an extended bonus of Christmas.  When I was growing up, my mother always made (NOT bought) me a red velvet cake topped with real buttermilk based frosting. If I (hypothetically) were to have made any diet related new year's resolutions as a youth, my efforts towards staying true would've been significantly compromised until my special day passed.
<br><br>
As I reminisced about birthdays past (as the thermometer was dropping like a rock), I suddenly knew my song of the day: Michael Franti's "11:59" which is a tune that I love almost as much as that velvet cake!  It frequently finds its way on to my yoga, cycle and (Des Moines) Dam to Dam playlists. I've seen Franti in concert more than a few times and he's a cool, humble, rockin' dude!!
<br><br>
The song's partial phrase: "It's 11:59 and 59 seconds..." pretty much sets you up with a great philosophy of how to live life. To me, operating in a 11:59:59 manner doesn't mean that I'm constantly doing the most amazing things; it merely emphasizes a conscious decision to put meaning into moments (notwithstanding the fact that I sometimes fail miserably in attempting this).  I occasionally reflect on this song when I feel like I'm not appreciating the moment in which I'm in which constitutes a personal breach of duty, i.e., the duty to appreciate life. The day of your birth is always a good reminder to extend gratitude for another year of sun, fun, tears and beers.  It's like this y'all: we all have our bills to pay, obligations to meet, etc. But at the end of the day, you gotta ask yourself: do i work to live or do I live to work?  Enjoy as many moments as you can! I will help if you'll help me :)

P.S. Likely this will not be the last music post of a MF song.
