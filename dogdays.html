Today, I participated in the Y’s annual 'Red Flannel Run.” This race is always an “iffy” one weather wise,
but this year the starting line temp was a balmy 40 plus degrees! Baller! The actual adornment of red flannel was a simply a costume apparel choice rather than a necessity for warmth. The moderate weather was also acceptable for my finicky husband (“Rik”) who refuses to run outside absent the existence of near perfect conditions (he’s high maintenance). So we headed downtown, found a parking spot and trekked up to my friend's office at the Y to pick up our race bibs (in which were incorporated our respective timing chips) that she had collected for us. As I dug them out of the bag, I handed Rik one and attached the other to my shirt. The race bibs did not have our names on them, but I assumed that the first number was mine since I registered myself first. Bibs firmly attached, we headed out towards the starting line to blend in with the anxious crowd all rocked out in red. 
<br><br>
The start gun went off promptly at 9 a.m., unleashing a torrent of racers comprised of men, women, children….and dogs. Given the favorable temp, canines were well represented in the this race. I eventually settled into my pace and rambled through the streets of downtown Des Moines. A couple miles in, I smiled as a saw a hound dog sporting a bandana. About half a mile later, the song "Dog Days are Over” presented on my playlist just as I was being overtaken by a woman and her little terrier. Damn. Any confidence that I was gonna churn out a PB that morning vanished when I saw “Toto" effortlessly trot past me. Next thing I know, Flo and the Machine is cranking in my headphones, so I smiled and reminded myself that at least I would cross the finish line ahead of my fair weather hubby. All is good. Run Toto run; you got game!
<br><br>
I really like this song. It also reminds me of a dance performed by the UHS Jaywalkers (dance team) during a Summer camp competition. We snatched the song up right when it came out and used it for camp, as I had a premonition that every other team would use it during the Winter competition season. I called that one… 
<br><br>
While the song propelled a little more spunk in my step, it didn’t provide me with enough fuel to catch that miniture doggie! I soon crossed the finish line and enjoyed the beautiful day while waiting for Rik to finish. We concluded our post race pleasantries with the other runners and headed home. All was good. 
<br><br>
Later that day, I heard Rik in another room gleefully proclaiming some type of a victory. Hmmmm… As luck would have it, he did indeed mistakenly wear my race bib (and its timing chip) and was now unabashedly claiming bragging rights via the fortuitous mixup. Rik immediately cashed in on his newfound success by proudly screen shotting the (alternative fact based) race results and texting them to our kids. Neat… :-) #untilnextime #totobeware
