                I've been binge watching "Mad Men." Set in the late 1950's / early 1960's, MM's portrayal of women brings my mother and mother-in-law to mind as this period encompassed their generation of mothering and "June Cleaver" wifery. Sadly, they both died in 2000; selfishly, I feel cheated by their early departures.
<br><br>
Erik's mom, Sue, fell to cancer and my mother, Millie, slowly lost her battle with Alzheimer's disease. I miss them everyday.  Fortunately, both my father and father in-law have since found caring companions with whom they continue sharing experiences and generating memories.
<br><br>
JT's "Fire and Rain" particularly evokes images of my mother for me and a longing to see my mama one more time. Her death occurred when my three children were very young, confining me to their mercy. Simultaneously, this scenario was occurring with Erik's mother (a/k/a "Grandma Sue"). My greatest sadness is that my kids did not get to experience their grandmothers. Lainey and Armond have happy yet limited memories of GS, but my mother's illness was quite advanced by the time they were born. Supie came aboard simply too late.
<br><br>
I got to see JT in concert in Ames. I went with a close high school (turned sorority sister) friend. It was awesome!  I knew every song. He usually found a spot on many of my mix tapes when I was a mere college student navigating the University of Iowa campus with my walkman.  Even at showtime, I drew the connection between this beautiful song and my mother.  I was a "surprise" completion to my family.  My siblings are 10-15 years older than me.  My mother's memory began failing around the time I graduated from college.  Fire and Rain is a timeless piece of work. Consider fire and rain as two separate, sometimes competing elements. While body and mind don't necessarily compete, one usually outlives the other. For my mother, her body outlived her mind.  For Sue, her mind out preformed her body.
<br><br>
Ugh!!... I wish that I could have done more both of them during the years leading up to their deaths. Mommy survival mode was my M.O. in the late 90's. I was sporting a newborn and 2 toddlers with me everywhere I went. I was clearly out numbered.
<br><br>
The phrase, "And I've always thought I've seen you one more time again..." takes me back: there were so many questions left unanswered.
<br><br>
To those still reading, hug your loved ones immediately! We never know what day is our last. Peace and love to Sue and Millie. You are greatly missed, but more importantly, your imprint on your families is fiercely alive. Their mind and body may have left, but their spirit remains. "Lord knows when the cold wind blows it will turn your head around..." wink, wink
