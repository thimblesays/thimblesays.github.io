                The Coldplay song, "Yellow", was played on the radio while I drove to work this morning.  A song that I suspect will appear in a later post. Oddly, the song "Yellow" immediately brought my attention to another one of Coldplay's songs, "Up&amp;Up".  Up&amp;Up is a warm song.
<br><br>
Since I first heard this song, I found it interesting and uplifting. Tonight, I pulled up its lyrics, simply to read them and absorb their meaning.  It has a slow groove but positive vibe.
In the simplest terms, I think this song's message says, "Hang on...don't give up...you've got this".  Some days that's all we really need and all that we should expect.
<br><br>
I had a yoga teacher once tell us (I'm paraphrasing here), "When someone asks you how you are, you should respond: not bad, not good".  Full disclosure, at the time, I thought that it was kind of jerk thing to say. Over the course of the next day, I was kind of all right with it.
<br><br>
Back to Coldplay, last two lines of Up&amp;Up are
"Don't ever give up
Believe in love"
<br><br>
Happy Tuesday!
